She discovered three different periods with varying degrees of network variance - Period A, Period B, and Period C - in her analysis:\n\nPeriod A saw average daily changes across all parameters were within 10%.\nPeriod B exhibited an overall drop in the data variance from 30% to 20% for all monitored parameters.\nPeriod C showed the largest variation observed at times - the standard deviation of each parameter was recorded as a percentage of the mean.\n\nThe scientist is now trying to identify which period had the lowest network variance for temperature and blood pressure only. She knows that \n\n1. The periods have different variations for all parameters, meaning there's no overlap in the variance levels across all monitored parameters for any two periods.\n2. There was a period of time where there were significant drops in variance, but it wasn't in Period B. \n3. The period with the largest variation for temperature was immediately before the period when blood pressure experienced an increase in network variance.\n\nQuestion: Which periods have the lowest network variance for temperature and blood pressure only?\n\n\nSince Periods A and B show all parameters changing within 10% which indicates low network variance, but this does not answer the question. \nPeriod C was noted to have a significant drop in the overall data variance which could potentially mean that it also has periods with significantly less variance for individual parameters.\nWe know from rule 3 that Temperature's largest variation occurred before blood pressure had its variance increase. This means, the periods that follow temperature's maximum variance should not show an increase in network variance for Blood Pressure. The periods immediately after Period C is the only time period where such a situation can occur. \nFrom this, we can infer that the lowest network variance for both Temperature and Blood Pressure is found within Periods A, B or D following Period C, but it cannot be directly determined which of these are the correct ones due to insufficient information. \nPeriod D was mentioned only as having 'significant drops in variance' implying there were periods with higher than usual variance before it - this might mean that the variance for Blood Pressure increased after Period D. Therefore we can rule out Period D. \nAnswer: The lowest network variance for Temperature and Blood Pressure is found in one of the remaining periods - either A, B or C. But as none of these options are provided with enough information to definitively say which period it is, the solution cannot be determined using available data alone. This puzzle presents a paradoxical situation where all three statements contradict each other under current conditions, highlighting a need for further analysis and data availability.\n"}
